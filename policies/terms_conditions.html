                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3">4. The Service: Ride Matching and Communication</h2>
                <p>Covoiturage TN provides a platform to connect users seeking rides (Passengers) with users offering rides in their private vehicles (Drivers). We are not a transportation carrier and do not provide transportation services ourselves.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Users agree that limited personal details (such as name, profile picture, phone number, user rating, comments, general location/route) will be shared with other users as necessary to facilitate ride matching, communication, and the completion of rides.</li>
                    <li>Users are solely responsible for their decisions regarding offering, accepting, and completing rides.</li>
                    <li>We do not guarantee the availability, quality, safety, or legality of rides offered or requested through the App.</li>

                <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Drivers and Passengers should agree on any cost-sharing amount beforehand.</li>
                    <li>Covoiturage TN holds **no responsibility or liability** for payment disputes, non-payment, or any issues arising from these offline financial transactions between users.</li>
                    <li>The Service is intended for cost-sharing, not for commercial profit by Drivers using private vehicles in violation of local regulations.</li>
                </ul>
