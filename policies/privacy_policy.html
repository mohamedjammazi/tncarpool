                <p>Welcome to Covoiturage TN ("we," "us," "our"). Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the app.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3">Data Collection and Usage</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">We collect the following types of information for the purposes described below to provide and improve our carpooling service:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Location Data (via OpenStreetMap integration):</strong> We collect precise location data when the App is running in the foreground or background (only during an active ride). This is used solely to:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 pl-4 text-sm">
                            <li>Facilitate ride matching between drivers and passengers.</li>
                            <li>Optimize routes for planned rides.</li>
                            <li>Enable real-time tracking of ongoing rides for safety and convenience.</li>
                        </ul>
                         We do not share your precise location data with third parties outside of the core functionality required to connect drivers and passengers for a ride arranged through the App.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Microphone and Camera Access:</strong> The App requests access to your device's microphone and camera. This access is used exclusively to enable optional real-time voice and video communication features between riders and drivers *within* the App during the coordination or duration of a ride. Audio and video streams from these communications are transmitted peer-to-peer or via necessary servers but are **not stored or retained** by us or any third-party servers after the communication ends. Usage of this feature is optional.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User Information (via Google Sign-In):</strong> We use Google Sign-In for authentication. When you sign in, we receive access to certain information from your Google account based on your Google permissions. We **never** receive, store, or have access to your Google account password. The data collected typically includes:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 pl-4 text-sm">
                            <li>Your Name</li>
                            <li>Your Email Address</li>
                            <li>Your Google Account Profile Picture URL</li>
                        </ul>
                        This information is used for user identification within the App, authentication, displaying your profile to other users you interact with (e.g., potential drivers/riders), and facilitating communication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Phone Number:</strong> We collect your phone number during the sign-up process for new users. This number is collected solely to enable direct communication (e.g., calls or SMS initiated by users) between riders and drivers for coordinating ride details (like pickup location or timing). Your phone number is **not shared** with any external marketing agencies or unrelated third-party entities. Other users will only see your number if you are matched for a ride.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User Ratings and Comments:</strong> After a ride, users may rate each other and provide comments. This information is collected to maintain the safety, reliability, and quality of the carpooling community and service. Ratings and comments may be visible to other users on profiles. This data is stored securely on our servers.
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Device Information & Usage Data:</strong> We may collect device identifiers, crash logs, and usage analytics to help us diagnose problems, improve app performance, and understand how users interact with the App. This data is typically anonymized or aggregated.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3">Data Storage and Security</h2>
                <p>All collected personal information (such as your profile information, phone number, ratings, ride history) is securely stored using Firebase Cloud Services (provided by Google). We implement industry-standard technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>

                    <li><strong>Between Users:</strong> To facilitate the carpooling service, limited information is shared between matched drivers and passengers (e.g., name, profile picture, rating, phone number, pickup/dropoff points, real-time location during the ride).</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party services like Firebase (Google Cloud) for backend infrastructure, database storage, authentication, and potentially analytics. These providers have access to data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</li>
                </ul>
                 <p class="mt-4">We do not share your data with third-party advertisers.</p>
